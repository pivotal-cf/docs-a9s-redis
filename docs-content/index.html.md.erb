This documentation describes the a9s Redis for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) tile. a9s Redis for PCF
enables on-demand provisioning of VM-based, dedicated Redis servers. Developers can
create instances of a Redis server using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line
interface (cf CLI) and bind these instances to an application.

<p class="note warning">
<strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>
The a9s Redis for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) tile is currently in beta and is intended for evaluation and test purposes only. Do not use this product in a PCF production environment.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

When you run the cf CLI ```create-service a9s-redis``` command,
PCF creates dedicated VMs for this service instance. This allows
the best possible bad neighborhood protection.

Redis service instance provisioning, including VM orchestration, is entirely automated.
This enables service instances to be highly isolated and shielded by infrastructure virtualization
mechanisms.

Due to the on-demand provisioning on VMs, only existing service
instances allocate infrastructure resources. These resources are released when service
instances are destroyed. Using on-demand provisioning the number of
service instances is not limited by design.

### <a></a>Current Features

The current version of a9s Redis for PCF includes the following key features:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **OnÂ­-Demand Service Instance Provisioning** | a9s Redis for PCF deploys Redis instances automatically. Developers can provision a single-VM Redis server using a single command. |
| **Service Instance Isolation** | Each Redis server runs on a dedicated VM to ensure bad neighborhood protection in order to be aligned with enterprise security requirements.<br/><br/>a9s Redis for PCF uses Cloud Foundry security groups to prevent network connections being established by unauthorized applications.
| **Smoke Tests** | a9s Redis for PCF contains a post-deploy smoke tests errand that runs a series of basic test against your installation to ensure that it is configured properly. |
| **Service Instance Capacity Upgrade** | Cloud Foundry Service Plan updates allow upgrades to the RAM, CPU and storage capacity for your Redis instances. |
| **Logging and Monitoring** | Each Redis service instance provides log messages and Redis-specific metrics to one or more `syslog/graphite` endpoints. You can configure the `syslog/graphite` endpoint to receive logging and monitoring information. |
| **Deployment Updater** | This errand automatically updates the stemcell and all provisioned a9s Redis for PCF service instances to their lastest version. |
| **Backup Manager** | The Backup Manager does regular backup of your instances and offers endpoints to backup instantly and restore backups. |
| **Service Guard** | The Service Guard creates Cloud Foundry security groups for your service instance VMs.<br /><br /> When the IP address of a service instance changes, the guard updates the security group. The Service Guard also restarts the application instances bound to the affected service instance. **The instances of one application are restarted one by one to avoid downtime.**|
| **Customazible Snapshots** | a9s Redis for PCF supports RDB persistence with point in time snapshots.<br />This setting can be changed by the user. |
