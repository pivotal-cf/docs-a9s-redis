This topic describes how to use a9s Redis.


## <a id='use-a9s-redis-with-an-app'></a> Use a9s Redis with an App

To use a9s Redis with an app, create a service instance and bind the service
instance to your app. For more information about managing service instances, see
[Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html).

### <a id='view-the-a9s-redis-service'></a> View the a9s Redis Service

After the tile is installed, you can see the `a9s-redis32` and its service plans
appear in your CF marketplace. Run `cf marketplace` to see the service listing:

```bash
$ cf marketplace
Getting services from marketplace in org test / space test as admin...
OK
service        plans                                                                           description
a9s-redis32    redis-single-small, redis-single-big, redis-cluster-small, redis-cluster-big    This is the anynines Redis 32 service.
```

### <a id='create-a-service-instance'></a> Create a Service Instance

To provision a Redis database, run `cf create-service`.

```bash
$ cf create-service a9s-redis32 redis-single-small my-redis-service
```

Depending on your infrastructure and service broker utilization, it might take
several minutes to create the service instance.

Run `cf services` to view the creation status. This command displays a list of
all your service instances. To view the status of a specific service instance,
run `cf service NAME-OF-YOUR-SERVICE`.

### <a id='bind-an-app-to-a-service-instance'></a> Bind an App to a Service Instance

After your database is created, run `cf bind-service` to bind the service to your
app:

```bash
$ cf bind-service a9s-redis-app my-redis-service
```

### <a id='restage-or-restart-your-app'></a> Restage or Restart Your App

To enable your app to access the service instance, run `cf restage` or
`cf restart` to restage or restart your app.

### <a id='obtain-service-instance-access-credentials'></a> Obtain Service Instance Access Credentials

After a service instance is bound to an app, the credentials of your Redis
database are stored in the environment variables of the app. Run
`cf env APP-NAME` to display the environment variables.

You can find the credentials in the [VCAP_SERVICES](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES) key.

```bash
$ cf env a9s-redis-app
Getting env variables for app a9s-redis-app in org test / space test as admin...
OK

System-Provided:
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "a9s-redis": [
   {
    "credentials": {
      "dns_servers": [
        "172.28.10.22",
        "172.28.11.11",
        "172.28.12.11"
      ],
      "host": [
        "d67901c.service.dc1.a9svs"
      ],
      "host_ip": [
        "172.28.25.12"
      ],
      "port": 6379
      "password": "a9s-brk-usr",
      "username": "a9s-password"
    },
    "label": "a9s-redis",
    "name": "my-redis-service",
    "plan": "redis-single-non-persistent-small",
   }
  ]
 }
}
...
```

You can use the host_ip, username, and password values to connect to your database
with a Redis client.

a9s Redis for PCF comes with its own Consul cluster to provide hostname resolving.
When your DNS is configured to resolve the a9s Redis for PCF service instance domains,
you can make use of `host`. <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For more
information, see [Name Resolving With Consul](./name-resolving.html#name-resolving-with-consul).</p>


## <a id='delete-an-a9s-redis-service-instance'></a> Delete an a9s Redis Service Instance

<p class='note warning'><strong>WARNING:</strong> Before deleting a service instance,
you must back up data stored in your database. This operation cannot be undone and
all the data is lost when the service is deleted.</p>

Before you can delete a service instance, you must unbind it from all apps.

### <a id='list-available-services'></a> List Available Services

Run `cf services` to list available services.

```bash
$ cf services

Getting services in org test / space test as admin...
OK

name                 service       plan                   bound apps        last operation
my-redis-service     a9s-redis     redis-single-small     a9s-redis-app     create succeeded
```

This example shows that `my-redis-service` is bound to the `a9s-redis-app` app.

### <a id='unbind-a-service-instance'></a> Unbind a Service Instance

Run `cf unbind-service` to unbind the service from your app:

```bash
$ cf unbind-service a9s-redis-app my-redis-service
```

### <a id='delete-a-service-instance'></a> Delete a Service Instance

After unbinding the service, it is no longer bound to an app. Run `cf delete-service`
to delete the service:

```bash
$ cf delete-service my-redis-service
```

It may take several minutes to delete the service. Deleting a service de-provisions
the corresponding infrastructure resources. Run the `cf services` command to view
the deletion status.


## <a id='upgrade-the-service-instance-to-another-service-plan'></a> Upgrade the Service Instance to Another Service Plan

Once created, you can upgrade your service instance to another, larger service plan.
A larger service plan provides more CPU, RAM and storage. For more information, see
the  [Update a Service Instance](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html#update_service)
of the _Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI_ topic.

```bash
$ cf update-service my-redis-service -p a-bigger-plan
```

Here are the plans you can upgrade to, depending on the one you are currently using:

| Base Plan | Target Plan |
|------|-----------|
| redis-single-nano | redis-single-small <br> redis-single-medium <br> redis-single-big <br> redis-cluster-small <br> redis-cluster-medium <br> redis-cluster-big |
| redis-single-small | redis-single-medium <br> redis-single-big <br> redis-cluster-small <br> redis-cluster-medium <br> redis-cluster-big |
| redis-single-medium | redis-single-big <br> redis-cluster-medium <br> redis-cluster-big |
| redis-single-big | redis-cluster-big |
| redis-cluster-small | redis-cluster-medium <br> redis-cluster-big |
| redis-cluster-medium | redis-cluster-big |
| redis-single-nano-ssl | redis-single-small-ssl <br> redis-single-medium-ssl <br> redis-single-big-ssl <br> redis-cluster-small-ssl <br> redis-cluster-medium-ssl <br> redis-cluster-big-ssl |
| redis-single-small-ssl | redis-single-medium-ssl <br> redis-single-big-ssl <br> redis-cluster-small-ssl <br> redis-cluster-medium-ssl <br> redis-cluster-big-ssl |
| redis-single-medium-ssl | redis-single-big-ssl <br> redis-cluster-medium-ssl <br> redis-cluster-big-ssl |
| redis-single-big-ssl | redis-cluster-big-ssl |
| redis-cluster-small-ssl | redis-cluster-medium-ssl <br> redis-cluster-big-ssl |
| redis-cluster-medium-ssl | redis-cluster-big-ssl |


## <a id='change-rdb-persistence-settings'></a> Change RDB Persistence Settings

a9s Redis supports RDB persistence with point-in-time snapshots. This setting can
be changed by the user.

### <a id='default-behavior'></a> Default Behavior

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| save 900 1 | Create a snapshot after 900 seconds if 1 write operations occurred. |
| save 300 10 | Create a snapshot after 300 seconds if 10 write operations occurred. |
| save 60 10000 | Create a snapshot after 300 seconds if 10 write operations occurred. |

### <a id='configuring-rdb'></a> Configuring RDB
You can configure RDB according to the needs of your apps by providing customer
settings. This setting must follow the original Redis configuration for RDB
`-c {"snapshot": "['save 900 1', 'save 300 10']"}`.

```bash
  $ cf update-service my-redis-service -c {"snapshot": "['save 900 1', 'save 300 10']"}
```

In this example, it is configured to snapshot the Redis database according to the
following rules:

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| save 900 1 | Create a snapshot after 900 seconds if 1 write operations occurred. |
| save 300 10 | Create a snapshot after 300 seconds if 10 write operations occurred. |

### <a id='cache-only'></a> Cache Only
You can disable snapshots and use Redis as cache only by creating the service with
the following customer setting `-c '{"snapshot": "[]"}'`.

```bash
  $ cf update-service my-redis-service -c {"snapshot": "[]"}
```

For more information, see the snapshot settings in the documentation of
[Redis Persistence](https://redis.io/topics/persistence).


## <a id='change-maxmemory-policy'></a> Change Maxmemory Policy

With the maxmemory_policy, you can configure a9s Redis which key to remove when
maxmemory is reached. Ther are several configurable behaviors. `noeviction` is
the default.

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| volatile-lru | Remove the key with an expire set using an LRU algorithm |
| allkeys-lru | Remove any key according to the LRU algorithm |
| volatile-random | Remove a random key with an expire set |
| allkeys-random | Remove any random key |
| volatile-ttl | Remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL) |
| noeviction | Do not expire at all, just return an error on write operations |

You can use `-c {"maxmemory_policy": "volatile-ttl"}` to update the maxmemory-policy.

```bash
  $ cf update-service my-redis-service -c {"maxmemory_policy": "volatile-ttl"}
```

For more information, see the maxmemory-policy settings in the self documented
[redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/3.2/redis.conf).


## <a id='ha-cluster-with-redis-sentinel'></a> HA Cluster with Redis Sentinel

a9s Redis uses [Redis Sentinel](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel) to provide a
high available replication set. Redis Sentinel monitors the several nodes, takes
care of automatic failover, and sends notifcation when something in the cluster changes.

a9s Redis provides two settings to adjust the cluster behaviour, `min_slaves_max_lag`
and `down_after_milliseconds`.

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| min\_slaves\_max\_lag | Time in seconds the master waits before it stops accepting writes when slaves are no more reachable. Default is 10 seconds. min-slaves-to-write is set to 1 and cannot be changed. See [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/3.2/redis.conf). |
| down\_after\_milliseconds | Number of milliseconds the master should be unreachable in order to consider it in S_DOWN state. Default is 30000 ms. See [sentinel.conf](http://download.redis.io/redis-stable/sentinel.conf). |

```bash
  $ cf update-service my-redis-service -c {"min_slaves_max_lag": "10"}
```

```bash
  $ cf update-service my-redis-service -c {"down_after_milliseconds": "30000"}
```


## <a id='add-a-graphite-endpoint'></a> Add a Graphite Endpoint

If you want to monitor your service with Graphite, you can set an endpoint to where
the information will be sent with the `cf update-service` command. This command
expects the [-c flag](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html#arbitrary-params-binding)
and a JSON string containing the `graphite` and `metrics_prefix` keys. Depending
on your graphite provider, the `metrics_prefix` might require that each metric
must start with an API key in their name. You can also change the interval within
the data is send to the endpoint. To do this, modify `interval`; the default is 10s.

```bash
$ cf update-service my-redis-service -c '{ "graphite": ["yourspace.your-graphite-endpoint.com:12345"], "metrics_prefix": "your-api-key.my-cluster-redis", "interval": "5"}'
```


## <a id='add-a-syslog-endpoint'></a> Add a Syslog Endpoint

The `cf update-service` command used with the [-c flag](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html#arbitrary-params-binding)
can let you stream your logs to a third-party service. In this case, the command
expects a JSON string containing the `syslog` key. You can also change the interval
for the syslog with the same key than for the graphite endpoint `interval`.

```bash
$ cf update-service my-redis-service -c '{ "syslog": ["logs4.your-syslog-endpoint.com:54321"], "interval": "5" }'
```


## <a id='cloud-foundry-app-security-groups'></a> Cloud Foundry App Security Groups

This topic describes how to check whether a security group was created.

Each a9s Data Service will automatically create and update Cloud Foundry security
groups in order to protect service instances to be accessed by apps not
running in the same Cloud Foundry apps space. To understand Security Groups,
see [Application Security Groups](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/asg.html).

### <a id='get-service-instance-guid'></a> Get Service Instance GUID

Run `cf service INSTANCE_NAME --guid` to get the guid of the service instance.

```bash
$ cf service my-redis --guid
ca16f111-5073-40b7-973a-156c75dd3028
```

### <a id='check-available-security-groups'></a> Check Available Security Groups

To see all available security groups, run `cf security-groups`.

```bash
$cf security-groups
Getting security groups as demo@anynines.com
OK

     Name                                         Organization     Space
#0   public_networks
#1   dns
#2   tcp_open
#3   guard_432fb752-876d-443b-a311-a075f4df2237   demonstrations   demo
#4   guard_ca16f111-5073-40b7-973a-156c75dd3028   demonstrations   demo
```

There we can see a security group with the named `guard_ca16f111-5073-40b7-973a-156c75dd3028`
was successfully created.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> In some circumstances, the connection between
the app and the service instance is not possible. In this case, check to
see if a security group was created.</p>


## <a id='backup-and-restore-service-instances'></a> Back Up and Restore Service Instances

a9s Redis provides an easy way to create backups and restore if needed. For a more
detailed description see the [a9s Service Dashboard](a9s-service-dashboard.html)
documentation.

## <a id='make-a-service-instance-locally-available'></a> Make a Service Instance Locally Available

It is possible to access any of the a9s Data Services locally. You can connect with
a local client to the service for any purpose, such as debugging. CF provides a
smart way to create SSH forward tunnels through a pushed app. For more
information about this feature, see the [Accessing Apps with SSH](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-apps.html)
section of the CF documentation.

First, you must have an app bound to the service. To do this, see
[Bind an App to a Service Instance](./using.html#bind-an-app-to-a-service-instance).

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> `cf ssh` support must be enabled in the
platform. Your administrator can tell you whether it is enabled.</p>

### <a id='get-the-service-url-and-credentials'></a> Get the Service URL and Credentials

You must first follow the procedure in [Obtain Service Instance Access Credentials](./using.html#obtain-service-instance-access-credentials)
to get the hostname of the service and the user credentials.

```bash
$ cf env a9s-redis-app
Getting env variables for app a9s-redis-app in org test / space test as admin...
OK

System-Provided:
{
  "VCAP_SERVICES": {
   "a9s-redis": [
    {
      "credentials": {
        "dns_servers": [
          "172.28.10.22",
          "172.28.11.11",
          "172.28.12.11"
        ],
        "host": [
          "d67901c.service.dc1.a9svs"
        ],
        "host_ip": [
          "172.28.25.12"
        ],
        "port": 6379
        "password": "a9s-brk-usr",
        "username": "a9s-password"
     },
     "label": "a9s-redis",
     "name": "my-redis-service",
     "plan": "redis-cluster-small"
    }
   ]
  }
}
...
```

Note the host `d67901c.service.dc1.a9svs`, the username `a9s-brk-usr`, and the
password `a9s-password`. You will need these in the next step.

### <a id='create-a-tunnel-to-the-service'></a> Create a Tunnel to the Service

With `cf ssh`,  you can create am SSH forward tunnel to the management dashboard.
Use port `6379` to connect to the a9s Redis Instance.

```bash
$ cf ssh a9s-redis-app -L 6379:d67901c.service.dc1.a9svs:6379
vcap@956aaf4e-6da9-4f69-4b1d-8e631a403312:~$
```

When the SSH tunnel is open, you can access the instance using the address
`localhost:6379`.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to close the session by running
<code>exit</code>.</p>

## <a id="service-keys"></a> Service keys

To gain access to the service manually rather than binding apps to it, you can
use service keys.

### <a id="create-a-service-key"></a> Creating a Service Key

To create a key to the service instance `redis1` called `mykey`, run the following
command:

```bash
cf create-service-key redis1 mykey
```

### <a id="listing-service-keys"></a> Listing Service Keys

To list all the keys for the `redis1` service instance, run the following command:

```bash
cf service-keys redis1
```

### <a id="accessing-service-keys"></a> Accessing Service Keys

To obtain the key `mykey` from the `redis1` service instance, run the following
command:

```bash
cf service-key redis1 mykey
```

### <a id="deleting-service-keys"></a> Deleting Service Keys

To delete the key `mykey` from the service instance `redis1`, run the following
command:

```bash
cf delete-service-key redis1 mykey
```

## <a id='setup-disk-usage_alerts'></a> Setup Disk Usage Alerts

Each service instance node comes with the **a9s Parachute** component. This component
monitors *ephemeral* and *persistent* disk usage. If one of these disk usages reaches
the configured threshold of 80%, the **a9s Parachute** stops all processes on that
node. Once the processes gets stopped, **a9s Parachute** logs the following messages
to its log directory:

```
Limit reached for: persistent disk
```

or

```
Limit reached for: ephemeral disk
```

### <a id='how-to-restart-stopped-instances'></a> How to Restart Stopped Instances

To restart a stopped instance, the user can use the `cf update-service` command to
set the `max_disk_threshold` custom parameter. All values between 0 and 100 are allowed.
Updating the instance does two things, at first the limit is set to the new value
and the instance restarts.
&nbsp;
To set the value to 90% do the following:

```bash
$ cf update-service <SERVICE_NAME> -c '{"max_disk_threshold": "90"}'
```

The update takes some minutes until the service is restarted.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This is only a temporary solution. The nodes
are stopped when the threshold is reached again. For a long term solution the
service instance must be updated to a bigger plan.</p>
